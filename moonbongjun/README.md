Hi! I feel like I have to write in English, so I'll just do it.

My name is Bong jun Moon. In America people call me Andy. In Britain, they call me Andrew.

It's your choice how to call me. But in Korea, I prefer my korean name better then the others.

I have studied abroad since I was 13 years old. I have visited tens of countries, and settle at China. So I do speak Korean as native, acceptable English, a little stuttering Chinese(or Mandarin if you wanna say this way).

My interest in it technology was largely due to my father and the Chinese government. China has been blocking information so much. When I was in middle school, I secretly learned how to romport my cell phone in Hong Kong, so I remodeled all my family's cell phones.

My father is developing components of electronic devices such as panels and wireless coils in China. He've been working with Samsung for a long time and I'm pretty sure he is looking for a new partner soon.

At Hanyang University, I worked at the school independent film society for two years, and this semester, I am working on a YouTube project in collaboration with an in-house startup of Munhwa-Broadcasting-Corporation.

I love playing with computer components, so I think I've touched most of the entry components selling on the market. Most recently, I sold RTX 3090 and lowered it to 3080 and brought VR devices to home. I live alone, so lucky to have no restrictions buying it.

Instead, it's a bit of a flaw that all the money saved up has run out. Feels sorrow when I see my account balance.

So I think I'm almost done introducing myself. I wanted to get along with people and share a lot of ideas, so I came into Likelion. I hope I can meet good people this year and I want to be a good person also. I look forward to your kind cooperation! Thanks!# test
